The oldest captain in the Gotei 13, he has aged into a elderly man with a bald head, deep wrinkles, hooked nose, and pronounced cheekbones.

He has many scars on his body, with the two most prominent being a pair of long scars crossing above his right eye, one of which was left by his battle with his lieutenant.[5] In addition to the standard black shihakush≈ç, he wears a captain's long-sleeved haori draped over his back instead of actually wearing it, with its size being greatly exaggerated</p>
